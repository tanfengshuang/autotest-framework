# Copy this file to address_pools.cfg and edit it.
#
# This file specifies several MAC-IP ranges for each host in the network that
# may run KVM tests.  A MAC address must not be used twice, so these ranges
# must not overlap.  The VMs running on each host will only use MAC addresses
# from the pool of that host.
# If you wish to use a static MAC-IP mapping, where each MAC address range is
# mapped to a known corresponding IP address range, specify the bases of the IP
# address ranges in this file.
# If you specify a MAC address range without a corresponding IP address range,
# the IP addresses for that range will be determined at runtime by listening
# to DHCP traffic using tcpdump.
# If you wish to determine IP addresses using tcpdump in any case, regardless
# of any # IP addresses specified in this file, uncomment the following line:
#always_use_tcpdump = yes
# You may also specify this parameter for specific hosts by adding it in the
# appropriate sections below.
